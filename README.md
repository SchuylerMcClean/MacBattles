# MacBattles

Our app blends the spontaneous nature of BeReal with the real-world exploration of Pokémon Go. A daily prompt encourages community engagement and a chance to earn points in a Pokemon-like battle!

Made by Schuyler McClean and Austin Bray for Deltahacks 12, January 10-11 2026.

## Inspiration

We wanted to build a game that would promote community engagement and health. Most people these days are glued to their phones without talking to each other and it is hard to meet new people. We were inspired to build a game that would reward players for interacting in person, strengthening the McMaster community.

## What it does

MacBattles is a game that incorporates the spontaneous nature of BeReal, as well as the real-world exploration of Pokemon Go. Each day, users will be prompted to visit a specific location on the McMaster campus within a tight time frame; an hour for example. At that location, they must engage with other community members in order to initiate a battle, where their pet characters will battle. Players will be rewarded points for visiting the location, engaging and winning in battles, and winning the most battles at an event (Top 1%, 10%, 25%).

## How we built it

We built this app as a multiplatform application using Flutter and used Supabase for maintaining user and event data.

## Challenges we ran into

Originally we had planned to have four team members until one-by-one team members dropped out and resulted in only the two of us. Because of this, we had to come up with a realistic plan about how much we would be able to complete within the 24-hour time limit. One such impact is that we decided not to include a backend, which resulted in creative ways to incorporate the Supabase database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of the final prototype we put together this weekend! We were able to successfully navigate all challenges we encountered throughout this weekend and still deliver a functioning product we are proud of.

## What we learned

In terms of technical and tangible skills, we improved our mobile development skills by building with Flutter, as well as improving our skills using relational databases by integrating Supabase for data storage. Additionally, this was a great challenge in terms of quickly picking up new technologies. The biggest takeaway however, was the importance of prioritizing the planning stage of the project. By effectively laying critical user journeys and creating a concrete order of precedence for these journeys, we were able to effectively prioritize the most important features, allowing us to have a MVP within the short timeframe.

## What's next for MacBattles

We have many plans for the future of MacBattles. Although an ambitious goal, we would love to deploy it on the web and/or android app store within the next few weeks after incorporating some more features!
